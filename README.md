### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a CS student based in Pardubice, Czech Republic.

On the programming side of things, I enjoy working within the MERN web dev stack - React.js, Node.js and MongoDB. I have also done a few basic mobile apps using Flutter and with the help of Python I peeked into the world of Raspberry Pi. I've also learned basics of Java, C#, TypeScript, Dart and of course SQL.

Besides programming, I am really into music. I play drums, guitar and flute. I also like climbing and photography and travelling.

I've participated twice on the Erasmus+ projects, creating aids for handicapped children and creating educational videos.

I'd love to collaborate on some international projects, gain new experiences, improve my coding skills and have fun with other developers.

_In case you want to contact me, you can do so through my email: jan.honza.hendrych@gmail.com_

To close up this bio, I'd love to share my favorite quote:
