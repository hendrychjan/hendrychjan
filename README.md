### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Honza, I am a CS student at FIT CTU in Prague, Czech Republic. My professional focus lies within the domain of IT, where I specialize in networks, IoT, web apps backend, and mobile development.

I have a profound appreciation for Open-Source Software and enjoy delving into its vast ecosystem. Utilizing GNU/Linux for both my hobby projects, and as my daily driver, and actively trying to contribute to the community by open-sourcing all of my work, embodying the ethos of collaboration and transparency in software development.

Beyond the screen, I'm a passionate musician and an adventurous soul who finds solace in mountain climbing and analog photography.

## Education and certification

I graduated from the Secondary School of Electrical Engineering, achieving all As in my final exams. 

Currently, I'm in the second year of pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague, where computer networks and computer systems are my primary field of study.

I have obtained Oracle certifications for "Database design" and "Database programming with SQL".

## Experience
#### Internship in a SW development company
I interned at [Tsium](https://www.tsium.cz/), where my primary responsibility was to develop a native mobile app for a platform showcasing IT conferences. This experience not only allowed me to contribute to a real-world project and deepen my experience working with Flutter, but also provided me with valuable insights into working collaboratively in the tech industry.

#### Erasmus+
During high school, I participated in two Erasmus+ projects where I collaborated with international teams from Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, France, Bulgaria, and Greece. In one project, we developed [3D aids for handicapped children](https://projekty.spse.cz/3dahc/project.html), while in the other, we created different [educational videos](https://projekty.spse.cz/vamlte/). My roles varied from being a contributor to a team coordinator, allowing me to enhance my leadership and collaboration skills while working on impactful projects with diverse international teams.

#### Freelancing
I did some freelancing using the [jaudelam.cz](https://www.jaudelam.cz/) platform, where I worked directly with clients to create custom mobile apps. This experience was invaluable in developing my abilities to engage with customers, manage expectations, handle payments, and oversee the entire development cycle from initial concept to the final product. Through this hands-on involvement, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the client-facing aspects of software development and cultivated project management skills.

## Projects and achievements
#### EXPO SCIENCE Amavet
At the [EXPO SCIENCE Amavet contest](http://amavet.fvtp.cz/?p=985), which attracts hundreds of students showcasing different kinds of projects, I presented my project 'Koishi.' Advancing to the final national round, I achieved 7th place overall, earning a special award from the dean of the Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering at CTU. This recognition not only highlighted my project's impact but also played a significant role in securing my admission to FIT CTU.

#### Koishi
Universal data visualization and collection platform. One of its standout features is its universality â€” you can input data through a classic web GUI, a mobile app, a REST API, or even a WebSocket API for real-time data. Users can then set up graphs to visualize the data efficiently. Koishi's versatility and innovative approach contributed to its success, including achieving 7th place in the Amavet contest previously mentioned.
