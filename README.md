### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am a CS student based in Pardubice, Czech Republic.

On the programming side of things, I enjoy working within the MERN web dev stack - React.js, Node.js and the beautiful MongoDB. I also did a few basic mobile apps using Flutter and with a help o Python I peeked into the world of Raspberry Pi. I've also learned the very basics of Java, C# and TypeScript.

Besides programming, I am really into music. I play drums, guitar and flute. I also like climbing and photography and travelling.

I've participated twice on the Erasmus+ projects, creating aids for handicapped children and creating educational videos.

I'd love to collaborate on some international project, to gain new experiences, improve my coding skills and have fun with other developers.

To close up this bio, I'd love to share my favorite quote:
